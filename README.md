# Web Scraping for XML Articles

## Overview

The **Web Scraping for XML Articles** project is designed to extract and analyze textual data from XML files containing articles. By utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project cleans, processes, and clusters the text data, providing insights into the content of the articles. The analysis includes data extraction, text preprocessing, feature extraction, and clustering, enabling users to understand patterns and themes within the articles.

## Purpose

In the age of information, extracting meaningful insights from large volumes of text data is essential. This project serves to:

- **Automate Data Extraction**: Efficiently scrape and process articles from XML files, reducing manual effort.
- **Enhance Text Analysis**: Utilize NLP techniques to clean and analyze text data for better understanding and insights.
- **Cluster Articles**: Group similar articles together based on their content, facilitating easier navigation and analysis.

## Features

- **XML Parsing**: Extract data from XML files using the ElementTree library.
- **Text Cleaning**: Remove HTML tags, special characters, and stop words from the text data.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenize, lemmatize, and normalize the text for further analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Use the Bag of Words and TF-IDF models to convert text data into numerical format.
- **Clustering**: Implement K-Means clustering to group articles based on their content.
- **Visualization**: Generate word clouds to visualize the most frequent terms in each cluster.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **BeautifulSoup**
- **NLTK**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**
